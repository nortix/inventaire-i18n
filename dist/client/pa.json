That's why <strong><a href=\"http://github.com/inventaire/inventaire/\" class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Inventaire's code</a> is a Free/Open software published under the <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html\" class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AGPL3 licence</a></strong>. Today, the Inventaire experiment has a centralized technical architecture as decentralized architectures are hard to achieve: efforts are focused on bringing users value from open knowledge with as little pain as possible, but finding ways to overcome this centralization is part of the trip.",
  "pitch_transition": "This is an experiment about resources and capabilities. Given a resource you have or you look for, what are your possibilities? Make, give, get from a gift, lend, borrow, rent, buy, sell, upcycle, recycle... The goal of the Inventaire project is to <strong>map those possibilities</strong>, make alternatives visible. At the same time, this is about easing resources data transparency and openness, and the transmission of those data from the business to the customer.",
