That's why **[Inventaire's code](http://github.com/inventaire/inventaire/) is a Free/Open software published under the [AGPL3 licence](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html)**. Today, the Inventaire experiment has a centralized technical architecture as decentralized architectures are hard to achieve: efforts are focused on bringing users value from open knowledge with as little pain as possible, but finding ways to overcome this centralization is part of the trip.",

At the same time, this is about easing resources data transparency and openness, and the transmission of those data from the business to the customer.",
